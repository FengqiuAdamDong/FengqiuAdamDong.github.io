      <description>I am a current 3rd year PhD candidate at the University of British Columbia. My research focusses on using CHIME/FRB and CHIME/Pulsar to find FRBs and pulsars. Futher, I am especially interested in their population. Currently I am the leader for the Galactic (Pulsar) Working Group for CHIME/FRB.

      <description>CHIME/FRB/Pulsar I conduct research with the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment (CHIME) telescope, specifically on the Pulsar and Fast Radio Burst (FRBs) backends (CHIME/Pulsar, CHIME/FRB). The CHIME radio telescope is located at the Dominion Radio Astrophysical Observatory (DRAO) near Penticton, British Columbia, Canada. At around +49° latitude, the design and shape of CHIME gives us a view of the whole northern hemisphere as well as down to about -20° in latitude.</description>
